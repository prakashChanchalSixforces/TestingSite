    review: "I had a very very positive experience with Lions Gate Moving last weekend. After many bad movers experiences before that in my life. This was the best by far. I was moving within the city from a one-bedroom sunken basement suite to an apartment building and was given a very reasonable quote of three movers (so it would be fast and efficient)."

    review: "Collected a bunch of quotes from different moving companies and went with Scott and Steven @Lions Gate Moving because of the initial conversation and reasonable quote. Friendly, communicative, small moving business. Showed up on time, with all the supplies and moved all my stuff without incident or damage!"

    review: " I used this moving company in late december with a lot snow on the ground. Alice accommodated my move after I required a few changes just few days before the move date. The movers were friendly, efficient, professional and worked great as a team üëè I would highly recommend this company to anyone requiring moving services.date=8 October"

    review: " I cannot say enough about how hardworking and positive the crew were when moving me. I was really having a stressful time with having to downsize and move after many years at my previous home. From the moment they came through the door the members of the crew reassured me and told me not to worry and that they were there to take care of me. They took very good care of me and of my mountain of belongings."
